# CryptoClustering_challenge

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

We'll execute clustering via K-means and refine the clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The task encompasses the subsequent stages:
1. Preparing and normalizing the data.
2. Determining the optimal 'k' value using the original dataset.
3. Employing K-means to cluster cryptocurrencies based on the original data.
4. Enhancing clusters through Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
5. Identifying the ideal 'k' value using PCA-transformed data.
6. Utilizing K-means for clustering cryptocurrencies with PCA-transformed data.
7. Visualizing and contrasting the outcomes.
